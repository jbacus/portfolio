                    <p>Initiated by a series of conversations I had with students at Wolfram Research's (first) New Kind of Science Summer School" at Brown University in the summer of 2003, "Datastructure" became my MArch. thesis project at Rice University in the 2002-2004 term. I was fascinated by the physical nature of information, and by the fact that information could be the basis for a fundamental kind of physical computation. My research wandered through related studies in information science, physical computation, graph theory, and more. I eventually proposed a new kind of library, one which was an active participant in the practice of research itself.</p>

                    <p>Simultaneous to this thesis project, I was also working as a Product Manager on the early startup stages of @Last Software and the products that eventually became SketchUp and LayOut. The 3D models below are some of the very earliest examples of SketchUp models in use for architectural design. My work on SketchUp in this period won a MacWorld "Product of the Year," a "Thesis Prize" honor for the Rice University School of Architecture, and a sign posted in the hallway outside John Casabarian's office prohibiting noisy phone calls. Guilty ;-)</p>
