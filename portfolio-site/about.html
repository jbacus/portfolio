                <div class="profile-intro">
                    <p>Designer, builder, and maker of things; builder of highly functional teams that work best by working together. Instructor, Interim Director of Undergraduate Program, Co-Chair Board of Advisors, ATLAS Institute; Eagle Scout, Scoutmaster; VP of Product Management, and member of the SketchUp startup team.</p>

                    <p>I make products that people love because they "...just work." I make teams that people love to work on because they "just work," too.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="profile-content">
                    <p>Here is my Resume. If you need some design support, some product management, or you just need help getting your team working together a little better than before, I'm keen to help.</p>

                    <p>You can Contact Me through this site, especially if you're looking for a phone number, email address, or physical mailing address. I'm always happy to chat, though I've had to become more selective in how much I expose to the wilds of the internet. You understand I'm sure.</p>

                    <p>In these times of cultural change, knowing where I stand on questions of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion is sometimes helpful. I've distilled that thinking into a concise Diversity Statement, which I invite you to review.</p>

                    <p>Lately, I've taken a more serious look at my Teaching Principles, and I invite you to have a look at them as well. While I have considerable executive-level experience with software development, I have a strong interest in teaching as well. I believe that to really know a topic, one should be able to teach it competently.</p>

                    <p>And lastly, I've given some particular thought to the principles under which I exercise my leadership. If you're interested, I have a Leadership Manifesto.</p>
