I'm always happy to chat, though I've had to become more selective in how much I expose to the wilds of the internet. You understand I'm sure.\n\nIn these times of cultural change, knowing where I stand on questions of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion is sometimes helpful. I've distilled that thinking into a concise Diversity Statement, which I invite you to review.\n\nLately, I've taken a more serious look at my Teaching Principles, and I invite you to have a look at them as well. While I have considerable executive-level experience with software development, I have a strong interest in teaching as well. I believe that to really know a topic, one should be able to teach it competently.\n\nAnd lastly, I've given some particular thought to the principles under which I exercise my leadership. If you're interested, I have a Leadership Manifesto."

I was fascinated by the physical nature of information, and by the fact that information could be the basis for a fundamental kind of physical computation. My research wandered through related studies in information science, physical computation, graph theory, and more. I eventually proposed a new kind of library, one which was an active participant in the practice of research itself.\n\nSimultaneous to this thesis project, I was also working as a Product Manager on the early startup stages of @Last Software and the products that eventually became SketchUp and LayOut. The 3D models below are some of the very earliest examples of SketchUp models in use for architectural design. My work on SketchUp in this period won a MacWorld \"Product of the Year,\" a \"Thesis Prize\" honor for the Rice University School of Architecture, and a sign posted in the hallway outside John Casabarian's office prohibiting noisy phone calls.

No sir– this is the robot you've always wanted to build. An insect-y hexapod that can walk. Still, this is a robot that you can really build. I know because we did it.\n\nSKPR was designed entirely in Google SketchUp, mainly because I wanted to prove that SketchUp was capable of modeling something complicated like a robot. Also that there was an easy and workable path from SketchUp to cnc fabrication machines that could bring the design into the real world. I think I proved that part was working fine."

      "body": "In high-functionality software applications, defined as applications that have more capabilities than might be completely understood by the average user at any single time, it is important to consider the 'learning' carefully in a continuum way rather than thinking that you'll be able to teach new users everything they need to know before they get fully engaged in their work. Springing from core educational thinking from Seymour Papert, Marvin Minsky, and others, I always felt SketchUp was best learned through play interactions. I think SketchUp is best learned by just messing around with it.\n\nIn or around the spring semester of 2006, I audited (along with two other colleagues from Google) a user experience design class at the University of Colorado taught by the indomitable Gerhard Fischer. I learned that \"expertise is a function of context, not people.\" I think what Gerhard meant by this was that people who learn to use high-functionality software applications (like SketchUp) should never be thought of as 'novices' or 'experts' in the tool as a whole but rather should be afforded learning opportunities at just the right time, in the right place, and in be the best format for that particular moment in their interaction with their work.\n\nFrom that course, I devised a design for a gradually disclosable help system, a chimera of a tooltip, a cursor, a status prompt, and a context-sensitive \"Instructor\" panel that would all work together to expand as the user paused for consideration. \"Learnability\" has always been something we cared about on the SketchUp team, and while this system was never fully realized, there are pieces in place all over the application as it ships today."
